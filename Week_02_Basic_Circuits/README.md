Perfect — you want it to sound more natural, like a student reflection rather than something that feels AI-written.
Here’s the cleaned-up and human-sounding version of your Week 2 README (same structure and tone as Week 1 👇):

## Week 2 – Basic Circuits & Ohm’s Law

### Goal

Learn the basics of electricity and how to safely build simple circuits using the Arduino UNO R4.
Understand voltage, current, and resistance through Ohm’s Law, learn how to read resistor color codes, and explore how the breadboard and Arduino pins work together.

### Activities

* Studied the different types of pins on the Arduino UNO R4 (digital, analog, power, and ground).
* Learned about Ohm’s Law and how to calculate safe resistor values for LEDs.
* Practiced reading resistor color codes using [Digi-Key’s calculator](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code).
* Built simple LED + resistor circuits on the breadboard and compared brightness using different resistor values.
* Documented the structure of the breadboard and how current flows through its rails.

> More detailed explanations can be found in the following files:
> • [Arduino UNO R4 Pins](./arduino_pins.md)
> • [Resistors and Color Codes](./resistors.md)
> • [Ohm’s Law & Basic Circuits](./ohms_law.md)

### Code / Project

[LED Resistor Test](./led_resistor_test/led_resistor_test.ino) – A simple sketch that turns an LED on and off through a 220 Ω resistor.
I also tested this without the resistor and the led gets noteably brighter

### Reflection

This week focused on understanding how electricity behaves in a circuit.
Learning how to calculate resistor values made it clearer why components need protection.
It was also useful to see how the breadboard and Arduino pins connect.

### Hours spent

7 hours

Would you like me to now write the linked detail pages (`arduino_pins.md`, `resistors.md`, `ohms_law.md`) so that this README connects cleanly to them?
