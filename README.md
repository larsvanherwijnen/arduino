# Arduino Learning Journey – Emerging Technologies Playground (Avans)

This repository documents my individual learning goal within the Minor Emerging Technologies Playground at Avans University of Applied Sciences.
As part of this elective, I chose to learn Arduino — something I’ve wanted to explore for a long time but never had the opportunity to fully dive into. This project allows me to finally do that: learning how electronics, sensors, and code come together to create interactive systems.

Over the course of 10 weeks, I’ll be building small projects to understand the fundamentals of Arduino and electronics, eventually applying that knowledge in a SmartLab integration project.
Each week has its own folder with notes, code, and experiments documenting my progress.
