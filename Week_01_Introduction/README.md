## Week 1 – Introduction

### Goal

Set up the arduino UNO R4 and the Arduino IDE, verify that everything works correctly, and explore all components included in the kit.
The goal for this week was to prepare the workspace, get familiar with the tools, and understand what each component is and does before starting any circuits.

### Activities

* Installed and configured the Arduino IDE.
* Connected the Arduino UNO R4 to my computer and successfully uploaded the Blink example sketch.
* Explored all components in my CMD kit (LEDs, resistors, sensors, servo, jumper wires, etc.).
* Made a list of all components and researched what they are and what they do. You can find that list here [**Components Overview**](./components.md)
* Verified that the Arduino board communicates properly via USB.

### Code / Project

[**Blink led**](./blink_led/blink_led.ino) – The first example sketch to verify the Arduino setup. 

The built-in LED blinks every second, confirming that the IDE installation and board communication work properly.

### Reflection

This week was mainly about preparation and exploration.
I successfully set up my Arduino environment and confirmed that the UNO R4 works by uploading the Blink sketch.
Creating a complete list of components helped me understand what’s available in my kit and gave me a clearer idea of what I’ll be able to build later on.

I didn’t create circuits yet, but I now feel ready to begin learning about electricity and circuit theory in Week 2.
The process was smooth overall, though I had to double-check the correct board settings in the Arduino IDE before uploading code.
