## Components Overview

For my learning goal, I bought a **hardware starter kit at CMD**, which includes the **Arduino UNO R4** and a range of sensors, modules, and basic electronic parts.
Below is a short explanation of each component and its purpose.

---

### Core Board

* **Arduino UNO R4** – The main microcontroller board. It’s the “brain” that runs code, reads data from sensors, and controls outputs like LEDs, motors, and displays.

### Cables & Connectors

* **Male–Male Jumper Wires (x2 sets)** – Used to connect components on the breadboard or between breadboard and Arduino.
* **Female–Male Jumper Wires (x1 set)** – Used to connect modules or sensors that have male pins directly to the Arduino.

### Interaction Components

* **Buttons (x2)** – Simple input switches that detect presses. Commonly used to trigger code actions.
* **Potentiometer (Variable Resistor)** – Adjusts voltage input, often used for brightness or speed control.

### Input Sensors

* **Light Sensor (Photoresistor / LDR)** – Detects brightness levels; resistance changes with light intensity. Can be used to turn LEDs on at night or read ambient light.
* **Gyroscope (Gyro Sensor)** – Measures rotation or tilt; useful for detecting movement or orientation.
* **Pressure Sensor (Force Sensor)** – Detects how much pressure or force is applied; useful for touch or weight-sensitive projects.
* **Distance Sensor (Ultrasonic Sensor)** – Measures the distance to nearby objects using sound waves. Commonly used for obstacle detection.

### Output Devices

* **Buzzer** – Creates sound or beeps when activated. Great for alerts or feedback.
* **Vibration Motor** – Small motor that creates vibration feedback; can simulate notifications or physical feedback.
* **Servo Motor** – A small motor with precise position control, used for moving arms, levers, or rotating objects.
* **LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes)** – Basic light components; can be turned on/off or blinked to show output or state.
* **RGB LED Strip (WS2812 8-bit)** – Addressable LED module with 8 RGB LEDs; allows individual color control using one data pin.

### Other Components

* **TIP 120 Transistor** – A power transistor used to control larger current loads (like motors or multiple LEDs) from the Arduino’s low-power pins.
* **Resistors (various values)** – Limit electrical current in circuits to protect components such as LEDs.
* **1N4007 Diode** - Protects circuits from reverse-voltage or back-current; often used with motors, relays, and the TIP 120 transistor to prevent damage.

### Breadboard

* **Breadboard** – A reusable platform for building and testing circuits without soldering. It allows quick prototyping and experimentation.
